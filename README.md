# Algorithm Study Repository

This repository contains my solutions to various algorithm problems, organized by categories for easy reference and learning.

## Categories

- **Dynamic Programming (DP)**

  - [Maximum Subarray](dp/maxSubArray.py)
  - [House Robber](dp/houseRob.py)
  - [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](dp/maxProfit.py)

- **Math**
  - [Count Primes](math/countPrime.py) - Count the number of prime numbers less than a non-negative number.
  - [FizzBuzz](math/fizzbuzz.py) - Classic FizzBuzz problem implementation.
  - [Is Power of Three](math/isPowerOfThree.py) - Check if a given integer is a power of three.
  - [Roman to Integer](math/romanToInteger.py) - Convert Roman numerals to integer with multiple approaches.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a personal collection of algorithm implementations that I've worked on to improve my problem-solving skills and understanding of different algorithms and data structures.
